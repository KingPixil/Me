					<b>Kabir</b> &#183; composer of functions
				</p>
				<p>I'm a high-schooler in California tinkering with computers to create new experiences.</p>
				<p>A perfectionist at heart, I dive deep into wherever my curiosity leads me. Functional programming, UI development, artificial intelligence, cryptography, quantum physics, linguistics, music, videography, economics, psychology â€” I've explored them all at some point.</p>

				<h4>Present</h4>
				<p>I&#39;m a junior in high school studying computer science as a part of our engineering academy. I co-founded <a href="https://cohack.netlify.app">Cohack</a>, where I teach students to code and host hackathons. At the same time, I&#39;m going down the rabbit hole of programming language theory and user interface development with <a href="https://moonjs.org">Moon</a>.</p>
<p>In my free time, I play soccer, lacrosse, guitar, and video games. I enjoy skateboarding and snowboarding too, but I&#39;m not too good at either.</p>

				<h4>Past</h4>
				<p>This summer, I worked as a junior engineer on the core team at <a href="https://webflow.com">Webflow</a>, a company pushing the limits of no-code.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I&#39;ve been obsessed with open-source projects. Some highlights include <a href="https://github.com/kbrsh/wade">Wade</a>, a 1kb JavaScript text search library; <a href="https://kbrsh.github.io/wing">Wing</a>, a beautiful CSS library; and <a href="https://github.com/kbrsh/slash">Slash</a>, a small hash function.</p>

				<h4>Future</h4>
				<p>I avoid detailed plans for the future; they&#39;re boring. Ultimately, I strive to challenge assumptions and invent crazy ideas. Work should involve creating new experiences, blurring the lines between science and art. Because while science might keep us living, art is what we live for.</p>
<p>For now, I plan on pursuing higher-level education in computer science. The allure of other fields will keep me learning, at least until I become a rockstar or something.</p>
