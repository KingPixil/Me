I avoid detailed plans for the future; they're boring. Ultimately, I strive to challenge assumptions and invent crazy ideas. My work should involve making meaningful experiences for humans, blurring the lines between science and art. Because while science might keep us living, art is what we live for.

For now, I plan on pursuing higher-level education in computer science. The allure of other fields will keep me learning, at least until I become a rockstar or something.
