This summer, I worked as a junior engineer on the core team at [Webflow](https://webflow.com), a company pushing the limits of no-code.

Over the past few years, I've been obsessed with open-source projects. Some highlights include [Wade](https://github.com/kbrsh/wade), a 1kb JavaScript text search library; [Wing](https://kbrsh.github.io/wing), a beautiful CSS library; and [Slash](https://github.com/kbrsh/slash), a small hash function.
