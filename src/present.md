I'm a junior in high school studying computer science as a part of our engineering academy. I co-founded [Cohack](https://cohack.netlify.app), where I teach students to code and host hackathons. At the same time, I'm going down the rabbit hole of programming language theory and user interface development with [Moon](https://moonjs.org).

In my free time, I play soccer, lacrosse, guitar, and video games. I enjoy skateboarding and snowboarding too, but I'm not too good at either.
