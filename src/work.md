[Cohack](https://cohack.netlify.app) is non-profit empowering students interested in computer science that I co-founded in the spring of 2020. I work as an instructor for our project-based workshops, designing our curriculum and teaching practical skills through live-coding and presentations. For our hackathons, I design events, manage resources, and handle relations.

[Webflow](https://webflow.com) is a no-code platform where I worked as a junior engineer on the core team during the summer of 2020. I wielded fundamental data structures and shipped exciting features at the forefront of their vision. An invaluable experience where functional programming, React-based user interface design, programming language theory, and performance collided.
